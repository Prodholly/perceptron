## Introduction

This repository presents the implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm**, a fundamental linear classifier in machine learning.
The Perceptron is a **binary classification algorithm** that finds a **linear decision boundary** to separate two classes of data points.

The algorithm iteratively updates the weight vector based on misclassified examples until a stopping criterion is met.
Here, two different stopping criteria are explored to analyze their impact on training and test performance.

## Algorithm Description

### Perceptron Algorithm

Given a training dataset:

$$
\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^n
$$

where \$x\_i \in \mathbb{R}^d\$ are feature vectors and \$y\_i \in {-1, +1}\$ are class labels, the algorithm learns a weight vector:

$$
w \in \mathbb{R}^d
$$

The prediction for a new input \$x\$ is:

$$
\hat{y} = \operatorname{sign}(w^\top x)
\tag{1}
$$

---

### Algorithm Steps

**Algorithm 1: Perceptron Learning Algorithm**

1. **Input:** Training data \${(x\_i, y\_i)}\_{i=1}^n\$, step size \$\alpha\$, stopping criterion
2. **Initialize:** \$w = 0\$ (all-zero vector)
3. Set \$t = 0\$ (iteration counter)
4. **repeat**

   1. errors = 0
   2. **for** \$i = 1\$ to \$n\$ **do**

      ```math
      \hat{y}_i = \operatorname{sign}(w^\top x_i)
      ```

      **if** \$\hat{y}\_i \neq y\_i\$ **then**

      ```math
      w \leftarrow w + \alpha \, y_i \, x_i
      ```

      errors ← errors + 1
   3. **end for**
   4. \$t \leftarrow t + 1\$
   5. Compute accuracy:

      $$
      \text{acc} = \frac{n - \text{errors}}{n}
      $$
5. **until** stopping criterion is met
6. **Return:** final weight vector \$w\$

---

### Update Rule

The weight update is:

$$
w^{(t+1)} = w^{(t)} + \alpha \, y_i \, x_i
\tag{2}
$$

---

## Experimental Setup

**Parameters**

* Step size: \$\alpha = 0.15\$
* Weight initialization: \$w = 0\$ (all zeros)

Two stopping criteria:

* **Criterion (a):** stop when **95%** of training data are correctly classified
* **Criterion (b):** stop when **80%** of training data are correctly classified

Metrics reported:

* **Training error** – percentage of misclassified training samples
* **Test error** – percentage of misclassified test samples
* **Number of iterations until convergence**

## Implementation Details

### Pixel Intensity Normalization

Normalize pixel intensities:

$$
x_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{x_{\text{raw}}}{255.0}
\tag{3}
$$

### Bias Term Augmentation

Add a bias feature:

$$
\tilde{x}_i =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
x_i
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\tilde{w} =
\begin{bmatrix}
w_0 \\
w
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{4,5}
$$

Decision function:

$$
\hat{y} = \operatorname{sign}(\tilde{w}^\top \tilde{x}) = \operatorname{sign}(w_0 + w^\top x)
\tag{6}
$$

### Dimensional Analysis

* Original images: \$28 \times 28 = 784\$ features
* After flattening and normalization: \$\mathbb{R}^{784}\$
* After bias augmentation: \$\mathbb{R}^{785}\$

### Weight Vector Initialization

$$
w = 0 \in \mathbb{R}^{785}
\tag{7}
$$

### Prediction and Accuracy

Prediction:

$$
\hat{y}_i = \operatorname{sign}(w^\top x_i)
\tag{8}
$$

Accuracy:

$$
\text{Accuracy} =
\frac{\text{Number of correct predictions}}{\text{Total samples}} \times 100\%
\tag{9}
$$

### 0-1 Loss

$$
L_{0\text{-}1} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{I}(y_i \neq \hat{y}_i)
\tag{11}
$$

## Analysis and Discussion

* **Rapid convergence:** Both criteria converged in just 1 epoch.
* **Identical performance:** Both criteria produced the same final accuracy (≈97.8%).
* **Excellent generalization:** Training and test errors are nearly identical (≈2.2%), indicating minimal overfitting.

## Conclusion

The perceptron algorithm achieved **≈97.8% accuracy** on both training and test sets and converged in a single epoch.
For linearly separable data, the choice of stopping criterion had little effect.

---

## Usage

1. Install dependencies (`numpy`, etc.)
2. Preprocess data (normalize, add bias)
3. Initialize perceptron weights to zeros
4. Train using chosen stopping criterion
5. Evaluate with 0-1 loss

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* (Optional) Matplotlib for visualization
* Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

This version is **fully Markdown-compatible** for GitHub, including LaTeX math (`$$...$$`), tables, and code formatting.

---

If you want, I can **also add ready-to-use code blocks from your notebook** with syntax highlighting so your README shows **full Python code examples** like a mini tutorial for recruiters. This makes the repo much more appealing.

Do you want me to do that next?
