Introduction

This repository presents the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a fundamental linear classifier in machine learning.
The Perceptron is a binary classification algorithm that finds a linear decision boundary to separate two classes of data points.

The algorithm iteratively updates the weight vector based on misclassified examples until a stopping criterion is met.
